#GibbsFW: A Gibbs Sampler for Finlay-Wilkinson Regression with unbalanced data
Plant breeders use Finlay-Wilkinson Regression to assess the stability of varieties across different environments. The routine method used in Finlay-Wilkinson regression is regressing the observed phenotypic values on environment means. Variety effect and the rate of change of variety across the environments are solved by ordinary least squares. However, when the data is unbalanced, for example, when only some varieties are grown on some environments while other varieties are growing on the other sets of environments, the mean performance on each environment will be confounded by performance of the specific varieties grown on this environment. In this case, therefore, the ordinary least square method will not give accurate estimate of environment effects and variety stability across environments.We wrote this R package to simultaneously estimate the environment effect and the genetic effect by Gibbs Sampling.  In the simulation of unbalanced data, we showed that the Gibbs Sampling performed better than the traditional Finlay-Wilkinson Regression by ordinary least squares.
